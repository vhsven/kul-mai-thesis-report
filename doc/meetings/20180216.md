# Thesis Presentation 1

## Minutiae

* Location: 200S 01.04
* Timeslot: 09h30 - 10h00

## Participants

* prof. Blockeel
* prof. Davis
* Elia Van Wolputte
* Sven Van Hove

## Notes

* Regression trees in weka, just not J48
* Very interested in nominal attribute problem
* Limit to 2-3 pruning algorithms
* Tim ? had problems with activity set
* Binary vs n-way -> n-way in scikit?
* one-hot encoding vs label encoder
* Graph suggestions:
  * Keep it simple
  * Subtract weka-scikit to clearly show difference
  * Work with y=x graph + above/below (?)
* Priorities
  * Must
    * Reproduce accuracy problem
    * Nominal values
      * keep extra array with nominal/non-nominal info
      * maybe first check if actually a problem?
    * Documentation
  * Should
    * 2-3 pruning algorithms
    * n-ary splits instead of only binary
  * Could
    * Regression
  * Would
    * Online learning
    * Missing values fix
    * Contribution ready code
    * Speed up
    * Lower memory usage
    * Ensembles (boosting leads too far)
    * Duration measurement reliability
