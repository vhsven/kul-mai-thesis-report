\begin{preface}
  I would like to thank Elia for the insightful discussions after business hours. I would also like to thank prof.\ Davis and prof.\ Blockeel for their helpful suggestions and the full jury for taking to time to read this document. My sincere gratitude also goes to my family and friends for their continued support. Finally, I would like to show appreciation towards my employer for the flexibility in my work schedule that made obtaining this degree possible.

% # APPROACH:
% 1. Investigate and characterize the differences in functionality between Weka and scikit-learn for decision trees.
% 2. Implement a python version of a decision tree learner that has the required basic functionality and that uses the scikit-learn interfaces.
% 3. Benchmark the developed implementation to those available in scikit-learn and Weka on a suite of datasets.
% 4. Translate the python implementation to C/cython in order to improve the run time performance.
% 5. Extend the decision tree implementation to more advance settings (e.g., online learning, â€¦).
% 6. Provide good documentation on how the code works.
