  I would like to thank everybody who kept me busy the last year,
  especially my promoter and my assistants. I would also like to thank the
  jury for reading the text. My sincere gratitude also goes to my wive and
  the rest of my family.

% # BACKGROUND
% Scikit Learn (scikit-learn.org/) is well-known and increasingly popular machine learning library implemented in python. 
% Surprisingly, its implementations for some algorithm, particularly for more classical techniques such as decision trees, 
% are very incomplete with respect to the functionality provided in other packages such as Weka (http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/). 
% The missing functionality can lead to large decreases in performance. For example, we have observed that Weka can be > 25% 
% improvements in classification accuracy on some datasets compared to Scikit Learn!
% # GOAL
% Develop a (more) complete python version of decision tree learners (and possible other algorithms) that works with Scikit Learn.
% # APPROACH:
% 1. Investigate and characterize the differences in functionality between Weka and Scikit Learn for decision trees.
% 2. Implement a python version of a decision tree learner that has the required basic functionality and that uses the scikit learn interfaces.
% 3. Benchmark the developed implementation to those availabe in Scikit Learn and Weka on a suite of datasets.
% 4. Translate the python implementation to C/cython in order to improve the run time performance.
% 5. Extend the decision tree implementation to more advance settings (e.g., online learning, â€¦).
% 6. Provide good documentation on how the code works.

\begin{abstract} %TODO update abstract
  The \texttt{abstract} environment contains a more extensive overview of
  the work. But it should be limited to one page.
