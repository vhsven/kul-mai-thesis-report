Intro

\section{Pruning}
%REP
%EBP

%Activity dataset problem could not be reproduced -> very good accuracy even without pruning

\section{Categorical attributes}

\section{Binary versus non-binary trees}
% Weka: binary vs non binary - significant differences
%   binary -> non-binary
%   tic-tac-toe: 
%       41.36 -> 10 nodes
%       21.18 -> 7 leaves
%       92.79 -> 68.96 accuracy
%       0.93 -> 0.71 F1
%   monks: always tree with only root node, no F1 score
%   activity: 85.66 -> 84.43 accuracy (no significant difference in F1)
% ==> non-binary same or disadvantage
